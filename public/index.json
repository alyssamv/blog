As part of this time off, I’ve been able to devote a good bit of time to the Tidy Tuesday datasets and learning new figures and vizualization tools - my extracurriculars. This week’s dataset was about 130k wine tasting ratings.\nThere was a lot of potential in this dataset, which includes information for each wine regarding its anem and variety, country, county/province, and other region of production, price per bottle, rating (on a scale from 0-100, but only wines with ratings above 80 are given), the name and Twitter handle of the wine taster, and notes from the taster based on their thoughts.\nI began by examining the distributions of each continuous variable, as well as some of the unique entries for the character variables (country, variety, etc). I found that there are 44 countries, 426 provinces, 19 different tasters, and 707 listed varieties of wine. I would love to classify these wines by white/red/rose/blends, but the length of this list was too long to do manually. Instead of finding another dataset for this purpose or using regex to help me, I looked at visualizing other variables.\nCode for all plots are given below, and full code on my data exploration and viz process can be found here.\nI’ve been reading Wilke’s Fundamentals of Data Visualization at the suggestion of a friend on Twitter, and got some great inspiration and tips for processing and conveying data. I thought I’d give myself a shot at a treemap (below), where I show the number of wines presented by each country at this tasting event. The US has the most with over 14,000 wines, followed by France and Italy. Additionally, I grouped countries into wine-production tiers based on these numbers; Tier 1 includes countries with more than 1,000 wines; Tier 2 is countries with between 100 and 1,000; Tier 3 is countries with less than 100 wines. I’m not a huge fan of this type of visualization personally, but thought I’d try my hand at it since it’s new to me.\nI was a bit surprised to see that the US leads with such grandeur in this count, but I suppose the wine competition (tasting? event?) was hosted in the US. I typically think of Italy and France as the wine capitals of the world.\nNext, I look at the distribution of wine ratings by country, for the top 10 wine-produing countries. The global median rating was 88/100. The US, Italy, and Portugal all seem to fall in line with this, with some highly rated outliers. Austria, Germany, and Australia standout as having a higher median wine rating.\nAlong with the distribution of ratings, price is also of interest. The distribution of prices was highly skewed, even in log-scale. The median price of a bottle of wine was $28, but still a handful of wines exceeded $1000. Again for each country, broken down by tier (as defined above), the prices are distributed as shown below. Tier 1 seems most responsible for the skewness mentioned, with many outliers. Meanwhile, Tier 3 has tighter distribution, albeit with fewer wines by definition.\nLastly, I was interested in how the ratings break down by the taster; do some tasters rate wines on average higher than others? The table shows us that, yes, they do.\n  Average ratings by tasters. Tiers are defined by the number of wines contributed (by country). The number of wines tasted by the taster is given in parentheses. A total of 129,971 wines were rated in the dataset: 96,137 in Tier 1 (producing more than 1,000 wines); 31,267 in Tier 2 (producing between 100 and 1,000 wines); 2,567 in Tier 3 (producing less than 100 wines). Tier 1 wines seem to have higher average ratings than lower tiers, though these differences are slight.

I’ve only participated a few times, but have learned so much already from seeing others’ figures and analysis routes, following along with code, and getting feedback. Twitter proves once again to be an excellent learning tool.\nThis past week’s dataset looked at global plastic waste (mis)management. Below I provide some of the code and figures I produced in exploring this data. As always, I wish the dataset provided us with even more information to wade through. Although, part of the fun is coming up with meaningful analysis from seemingly few variables. My code is available here.\nIn this dataset we find data about global plastic waste disposal in 2010. We also get information about county 2011 GDP, and coastal and total population according to Gapminder.\nIn looking at the distributions in the data, I noticed that there were around 50 missing values for several of the variables related to plastic waste. I explored a little bit the population and GDP attributes of these countries compared to others, and found that most of these countries with missing information fall in the 50th percentile for GDP. Let’s take a look at some of the data.\nThis figure also gives us some information about the distribution of population and GDP across the world. There are some outliers in both, with significantly large population and GDP, not shown in the scatter plot (China, India, and the USA).\nNext I started to look at the data on waste, and specifically the relationship between waste management and GDP/population. “Mismanaged waste” is defined by Our World in Data, the data source, as “material which is either littered or inadequately disposed”. First I plotted some scatterplots to get a feel for the association (if any). Below, we can see that the trend if such that richer countries have less waste per capita.\nNow I want to present the above information as a map, highlighting the top three countries (with regard to population and GDP) USA, China, and India.\nFinally, within each country, what percentage of their total plastic waste is being mismanaged? Does this also correspond to a country’s wealth? I decided to look at a scatterplot with overlaid boxplots across continents and levels of wealth (percentiles of GDP). It looks like the higher a country’s GDP per capita, the less of its plastic is being mismanaged.\n","date":1558915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558915200,"objectID":"3e5add690b084e743addb3dc68679467","permalink":"/post/tidytuesday-global-plastic-waste-management/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tidytuesday-global-plastic-waste-management/","section":"post","summary":"A few weeks ago I began participating in R’s community TidyTuesday; a community-based data visualization challenge, where a new dataset is released on Tuesday and participants are invited to create visualizations in the tidyverse.

The goal here is to provide (1) a brief summary of each phase and the common designs used, (2) some of the most popular areas of interest (eg randomization) and new methods that aim to address them, and (3) a summary of the biggest issues that clinicians/statisticians face in testing new agents. I will also be providing papers that I’ve found really useful/important in my own learning about this topic.\nA few notes on the material in this post: as a statistician in training, I will be talking about the statistical nature of the designs presented. I may present formulas, but will try to define as many terms as possible in order to appeal to a range of disciplines.\nWith that, let’s dive in.\nOncology research Let me first give a brief overview of research in oncology, because the landscape in this disease setting is different than in infectious diseases or psychiatry, for example. It’s a complex field. There are dozens of tumor types; location in the body, solid vs. other tumors, mutations, biomarker subtypes, etc. All of these factors make for tumors that respond very differently to different therapies. Consider HER-2 positive breast cancer, which is more difficult to treat than the HER-2 negative variant due to the aggression of the growth of tumor cells.\nWith research in any disease, we care about clinical outcomes. That is, improving the lives of patients. In cancer, this is most easily measured as survival time. So, when the goal or endpoint of a trial is specified, it often relates to these survival outcomes. But things like toxicity and quality of life are also important measures of how well a treatment is working. More on this topic later.\n Drug development If you’re unfamiliar with the drug development process as regulated by the US Food \u0026amp; Drug Administration (FDA), I will give an overview here. Feel free to skip down to details of trial designs below.\nTraditionally, there are five stages of development: (1) discovery and development of the molecule, (2) preclinical research, ie not in humans, (3) clinical research in humans, (4) FDA review, and (5) FDA post-market monitoring. I focus in this post on stage 3, clinical trials, which is broken down into three testing phases. Phase I is generally intended to test the safety of the new agent, and is tested only in a small number (dozens) of subjects. Once safety is established, phase II begins to test the efficacy while continuing to monitor safety, in more patients than phase I (dozens to a couple hundred). If it is determined that the experimental drug shows promising efficacy, it moves to phase III. Phase III seeks to establish how the efficacy of the new drug compares to that of some other existing treatment, usually the best available therapy. And this is often done in hundreds or thousands of subjects.\nSo, how is a new agent deemed to be safe or efficacious enough to move forward to the next phase? Excellent question. The answer is not so simple, and this is where statistics come into play.\nOnce upon a time, frequentist hypothesis testing came to save us all. Now we can test whether a drug is safe or effective and claim statistical significance when the p-value falls below that megical number 0.05 (or whatever we specify to be).\nSome important definitions before we continue: Endpoint: quantity we are measuring / testing in the trial; Surrogate endpoint: this actually has a very specific definition, but is essentially a proxy for the endpoint we really want to measure. The surrogate is used because it is easier to measure. It must be shown to do an adequate job of predicting the real outcome of interest;\nPhase I Historically, phase I studies were intended to test the safety of new drug, where we want to find the dose we would want to carry forward to phase II. This dose (the classic endpoint of this phase) is the Maximum Tolerated Dose, or MTD, which is defined as the highest dose with acceptable toxicity.\n Phase II  Phase III   ","date":1558051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558051200,"objectID":"76f72e0c88ea8772295ec18d30203e25","permalink":"/post/survey-of-early-phase-trial-designs-in-oncology/","publishdate":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/survey-of-early-phase-trial-designs-in-oncology/","section":"post","summary":"After a few years of working with clinical trial methodology, I finally decided to put together a introductory guide to common trial designs seen in oncology drug development.
