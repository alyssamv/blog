abstract: Background. There have been few treatment advances for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) despite increasing scientific understanding of the disease. While factors such as intrinsic tumor biology and drug delivery are chal- lenges to developing efficacious therapies, it is unclear whether the current clinical trial landscape is optimally evaluating new therapies and biomarkers. Methods. We queried ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional clinical trials for patients with GBM initiated between January 2005 and December 2016 and abstracted data regarding phase, status, start and end dates, testing loca- tions, endpoints, experimental interventions, sample size, clinical presentation/indication, and design to better understand the clinical trials landscape. Results. Only approximately 8%–11% of patients with newly diagnosed GBM enroll on clinical trials with a simi- lar estimate for all patients with GBM. Trial duration was similar across phases with median time to completion between 3 and 4 years. While 93% of clinical trials were in phases I–II, 26% of the overall clinical trial patient popula- tion was enrolled on phase III studies. Of the 8 completed phase III trials, only 1 reported positive results. Although 58% of the phase III trials were supported by phase II data with a similar endpoint, only 25% of these phase II trials were randomized. Conclusions. The clinical trials landscape for GBM is characterized by long development times, inadequate dissem- ination of information, suboptimal go/no-go decision making, and low patient participation.

summary: We examined the landscape of trials in glioblastoma registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between 2005-2016. Our findings show low patient enrollment, long trial duration, disproportionate allocation of patient to unsuccessful phase III trials, and lack of randomization in phase II.
